# Experimental Robotics Laboratory - Assignment 1
#### Behavioural Architecture
## Intoduction
This contains the Assignment 1 of Experimental Robotics Lab.The aim of this assignment is to implement a behavioural architecure for a robot that moves in a discrete 2D envirionment.The architecture involves perception components, a finite state machine as the command manager and a controller component.
